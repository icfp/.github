# üèÜ (Not Official) Personal ICFP Contest Org

## A place for our ICFP contest entries

### What is ICFP?

The International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) Programming Contest is a legendary 72-hour programming competition that has been running since 1998. Teams from around the world compete to solve challenging and creative problems, often involving complex algorithms, language design, or optimization challenges.

### Our Mission

This organization serves as a home for our team's ICFP contest submissions. Each year brings a new challenge, and we tackle them with enthusiasm, caffeine, and functional programming principles (when we remember to use them).

### Contest Years

- **ICFP 2024** - Our Rust-based solution ü¶Ä
- **ICFP 2025** - Coming September 5-8, 2025! üöÄ

### The ICFP Experience

72 hours. One problem. Infinite possibilities. Whether it's implementing a virtual machine, optimizing space probes, or solving abstract puzzles, each contest pushes us to think creatively and code efficiently.

### Tech Stack

We've used various languages and tools over the years:
- Rust for performance-critical solutions
- Whatever else seems fun at 3 AM on day two of the contest

### Join the Adventure

While this is our personal organization for contest entries, we welcome fellow ICFP enthusiasts to explore our solutions and share in the joy (and occasional frustration) of competitive programming.
